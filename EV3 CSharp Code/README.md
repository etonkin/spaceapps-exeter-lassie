# Lego Mindstorms EV3 C# control #

I used this library for interfacing with the EV3 brick

[http://legoev3.codeplex.com/](http://legoev3.codeplex.com/)

and here's a bit of a vid on the subject

or just add the NuGet package and get cracking

**PM> Install-Package Lego.Ev3**

The connection has been forced to Bluetooth (obviously pair the brick before you try to connect), but you can use Wifi or USB. There are some examples/docs here

I would recommend you do not use this code as it's pretty shoddy, but might be useful as a getting started hint ;-)
